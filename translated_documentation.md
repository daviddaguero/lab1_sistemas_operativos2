The project consists of the following files:

server.c: The central server provides a refuge state summary in JSON format, facilitating access to key information on alerts, supplies, and emergency notifications for people. Clients connect via a simple login, providing a username and password. Initially, communication via sockets is done using TCP/IP and ipv4. UDP and ipv6 will be implemented in future releases. When the server starts, it creates and configures a socket for TCP/IP operation, then forks into three processes, each of which executes one of the modules. The main server process receives notifications from the "possible_infection" and "emergency" modules. Upon an emergency notification from "emergency.c", the server closes all connections and notifies all clients. These notifications are implemented through signals. Authentication is performed, allowing only the client "ubuntu" to update the supplies_data module. Other clients can only query the current state of the refuge. Child processes are created to handle communication with each client.
The server will keep a log file with all the events that happens in the refuge. This file will be in the /var/log/ directory, and the name will be refuge.log.

client.c: It can be instantiated multiple times and simulates people seeking the refuge's current state summary. Each client has a unique username and password, with a special client "ubuntu" dedicated to updating supply information without querying the server. User credentials are provided as command-line arguments.

possible_infection.c: this module implements instant alerts for possible infected refuged. To simulate people's temperature measurements, random values between 36 and 40 degrees are used. If the random temperature value generated is greater than or equal to 38 degrees, it is considered that the person may be infected and an alert is sent. These alerts are implemented through signals. It is implemented as a static library. 
The simulated temperatures are recorded in a log file named "infections.log". These logs are stored in a directory named "infection_logs".

supplies_data.c: This module manages and updates information on available supplies, with updates initiated by the "ubuntu" client. Server-side authentication determines whether the requesting client is "ubuntu". Implemented as a static library.

emergency.c: This module generates instant emergency notifications, simulating power outages and critical situations with random periodic notifications. In this firs version, two types of notifications are sent: "power outages" and "other critical situations". The notification sent is randomly chosen and implemented using signals. This module is implemented as a dynamic library.
